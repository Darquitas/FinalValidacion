1. Clone the Million.js repository:

## Running the Kitchen Sink

You can run the Kitchen Sink application to explore the various scenarios and examples:

This command will start the development server and open the Kitchen Sink application in your default web browser.

## Examples

The Kitchen Sink showcases Million.js used in a variety of real-life scenarios, utilizing different technologies. Some of the examples you'll find include:

- **Jotai Counter**: A simple counter built with React and that uses Jotai for managing state.

- ...

Each example comes with its own code and resources, demonstrating how Million.js can be integrated into different projects and workflows.
