# Experimental Options

Million.js has various experimental features that can be toggled through experimental flags. This is to ensure that these features are tested and provide a positive experience prior to their official release as stable features.

Additionally, these experimental options serve to evaluate whether a specific feature can be fully integrated and delivered as part of the complete package.

## No `<slot />` 

Million.js wraps blocks and their reactive props (portals) with [`<slot />`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot) HTML tags so that it gets full control over the rendering! 

In the case of props, each block has no responsibility over the props it takes since they come from a different source. What it does in this case is that it wraps those props with `<slot />` and passes the rendering of those props to React.js. It should be noted that this does not apply to any prop.   

This experimental flag tries to achieve the removal of slots so that users would not be bothered with unexpected broken styles and `<slot />` elements.

### `block`

> For now, only blocks are supported in `noSlot` mode. Props are yet to be supported.

For [auto](/docs/automatic) mode, `noSlot` mode can be activated simply by adding this to your entry file:


```js
import { experimental_options } from 'million/experimental';

experimental_options.noSlot = true
// now `noSlot` mode is activated across your application  

function Lion() {
  return <img src="https://million.dev/lion.svg" />;
}
``` 

In [manual](/docs/manual-mode/block) mode, the `experimental_noSlot` can be passed to the block function.

```js
import { block } from 'million/react';
 
const LionBlock = block(
  function Lion() {
    return <img src="https://million.dev/lion.svg" />;
  },
  { experimental_noSlot: true },
);	
```

<Callout type="warning">
`noSlot` blocks do not support having siblings in their parents because handling non-block elements and elements that Million.js does not have any control over is challenging.

```jsx
<div>
  <span>first child</span>
  <LionBlock /> {/* ‚ùå Wrong */}
</div>

// üëáüëáüëá

<div>
  <span>first child</span>
  <div>
    <LionBlock /> {/* ‚úÖ Correct */}
  </div>
</div>
```
